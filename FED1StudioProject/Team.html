                    I'm Hector Toro, and I started creating my first released game in school, and continued to work with it while working a desk job. I was completely self taught throughout it's development. In addition, I've always been a clumsy and awkward guy. I've always had trouble grasping abstract concepts. But somehow I’ve consistently earned a six-figure income for half a decade making indie games.
